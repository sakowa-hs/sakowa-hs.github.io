Programmer are the wizard of the world. They are controlling the world. All the entertainment in the world is hapening because of programmers.<br><br>
Today world is technology based(I mean ICT).So the world is now trying to use the technology, trying to create brand new technologies. But do you know how to create a technology? Do you even thought that you can try to create a new technology, which shall be using all over the world like Microsoft Windows OS, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Amazon and so on? <br>If you can do something like this our country will be very proud of you and you also will be. It will be very great for you and also the world… <br>
			However, now if you are fond of technology and you want to create new technology , you must use computer….you must learn computer programming. Now it is your confusing time! What is computer programming?<br> Now I am explaining as I can as I do. <br> Computer programming is some set of instructions to give to a computer and the computer will work as the instructions are given. This is just a simple concept. I can not explain it fully here. However I am just trying. In the end of the page I added some links and what you can download or read online by Google Drive.  
Please don’t mind because I can not explaining fully. <br>
Now just providing the use of computer programming- <br>
The computer was created by programming.
The smart phone was created by programming.
A pilot when drive a Aeroplan , they use computer to control their Aeroplan and the computer use program and the program can be create only by programming ,I mean computer programming. Major of those program is written by a programming language like Ada,C,C++. C and C++ is most dominet. <br>
Do you know what is robot? Even do you thought how a robot do something automatically? How they reply our command? It uses computer programming. Here programming gives somethings like brain to a robot. <br>
For the blessing of programming we can talk to anyone by video calling with over the internet. <br>
A train or rail is now controlling by a computer and the computer is controlling by programming. <br>
I know you use social website like Facebook, Twitter, or linkedin or other. All of these websites created by programming. Without programming a dynamic website can not be created. <br>
A digital clock also created by programming.
The google was create by programming.
The MacOS and Windows OS (Operating System) was created by programming. <br>
Now a days we are very fond of computer and smartphone games. But even we thought how to create a game? A game or app I mean software can be create only by programming. Without programming,  game-app can not be created. <br>Programming is the main base all of this. <br>
Do you know we are sending satellite and aircraft over the earth, and this satellite and aircraft giving us many information about another planet ,also these gives us news about upcoming problems we going to fetch with the nature. How these can be done..it is programming. <br>	

			And so more information are available here and there .If I start to make a list of blessing of programming  it can not be done…You also can use your programming knowledge in another system(device) according to your idea. This all things up to you. <br>
Now I think you are attracted by programming. So if you want to know more you should ask to google.com. Google is the store house of knowledge. Any thing you can know by using the google…just remember that google was also created programming. By programming google maintain their huge database.
Now if you are wishing to be a programmer you just need to be patient and hardwork and also logic.
You should go ahead and carry on yourself. 
Programmers are the wizard of the future world(again).
So you should start your race  if you want to be a great wizard of the world.
