I have done so bla bla…however now if you are fond of technology and you want to create new technology , you must use computer….you must learn computer programming. Now its your confusing time! What is computer programming? Now I am explaining as I can as I do. Computer programming is some set of instructions to give to a computer and the computer will work as the instructions are given. This is just a simple concept. I can not explain it fully here. Because I am not so good in English to write and say. However I am just trying. In the end of the page I added some links and what you can download or read online by Google Drive.  
Please don’t mind because I can not explain fully.
Now just providing the use of computer programming-
The computer was created by programming.

Do you know we are sending satellite over the earth, and this satellite giving us many information about another planet. Also these gives us upcoming problems we going to fetch with the nature. How these can be done..it is programming.
And so more information are available here and there .If I start to make a list of blessing of programming  it can not be done…You also can use your programming knowledge in another system according to your idea. This all things up to you.
Now I think you are attracted by programming. So if you want to know more you should ask to google.com. Google is the store house of knowledge. Any thing you can know by using the google…just remember that google uses programming. By programming google maintain their huge database.
